    "# Story\n",
    "We would like to perform modelling grism emission instead of pixel extraction. Our main goal is to perform contamination removal from GRB 190829A data we have.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Previously\n",
    "Grism observation from HST is typically extracted by using pixel values, which is highly sensitive to fluctuation pixel-by-pixel as well as local noise such as cosmic rays and bad pixels. Using an emission model such as Gaussian will be stable, and can be benefits in various aspects such as:\n",
    "- We can apply smaller aperture width in the extraction.\n",
    "- We can perform line contamination removal.\n",
    "- We can develop more sophisticated extraction algorithm such as forward modelling.\n",
    "\n",
    "We note that [aXe software](https://www.stsci.edu/scientific-community/software/axe), as the standard HST grism extraction software, performs contamination modelling using Gaussian emission and Flux Cube model. \n",
    "\n",
    "# Here\n",
    "We will review related ISRs, software (such as [aXe](https://www.stsci.edu/scientific-community/software/axe)) document, and codes to get some ideas of important resources.\n"

    "- Gaussian emission model is a fundamental form to model grism emission. This requires FWHM which also shows to be wavelength dependent. A01 provides a functional form to estimate FWHM for WFC3 IR both G102 and G141. ISRs WFC3 2009-17 and 2009-18 provide the same information but from SMOV.\n",
